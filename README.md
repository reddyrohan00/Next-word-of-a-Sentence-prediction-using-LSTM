# Next_word_LSTM
🧠 Next Word Prediction with LSTM
This project explores the power of deep learning in natural language processing through a next word prediction model built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network.

By learning from a text corpus, the model can generate likely continuations of a given input phrase—enabling intelligent autocomplete, text generation, and conversational AI capabilities.

💡 What It Does
The model predicts the next most likely word based on an input sentence fragment. It uses:

A trained LSTM model for sequential learning.

A tokenizer that maps words to numeric sequences.

A padded input structure that mimics training-time input.

The result is a system that can understand basic patterns in language and offer meaningful word predictions.

🌟 Key Features
LSTM Architecture: Leverages memory across sequences for more context-aware predictions.

Tokenizer Integration: Maintains consistency between training and inference phases.

Pre-trained Model: Ready-to-use model trained on a custom or public corpus.

User Input Friendly: Accepts natural text input and returns single-word predictions.

Modular Design: Easily adaptable to larger pipelines like chatbots, story generators, or smart typing assistants.

📌 Notes
The model works best with inputs similar to the domain it was trained on.

Input text should be concise (a few words long) for accurate prediction.

Ensure the tokenizer used in prediction matches the one used during training.

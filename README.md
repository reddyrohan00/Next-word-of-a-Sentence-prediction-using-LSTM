# 🔮 **WordWhisperer**

### *Next-Word Prediction with LSTM for Smart Text Generation*

Unlock the power of deep learning to *predict what comes next*. **WordWhisperer** is an intelligent next-word predictor powered by an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network—designed to complete sentences, enhance writing, or power chatbots.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

Given a partial sentence, **WordWhisperer** predicts the next most likely word using:

* ✅ A trained **LSTM model** for sequence-aware predictions
* ✅ A fitted **Tokenizer** to convert words into numerical sequences
* ✅ **Padded sequences** that mirror training-time input

> Example input:
> `"Deep learning is"` → `"powerful"`
